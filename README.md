# Housing Data Matplotlib Project on Jupyter Notebooks

## Premise

Welcome to my section one project on national real estate metrics, done using the matplotlib, numpy, and pandas libraries on Python via Jupyter Notebooks.

Analyzing the housing dataset as shown here can prove to be useful not only for investors to forecast market trends and identify competitive investment opportunities, but also for suppliers to strategically place their firms to maximize market share, as well as for governments to optimize land use and assess infrastructure needs.

**The full report starts in the file entitled, 'Housing_proj_1', and then progresses to 'Housing_proj_2'.** Contained within are numerous types of graphs (bar, stacked bar, grouped bar, time-series, dual axis time-series, pie, histogram, stacked line plot, scatterplot, combination graphs) used to examine certain relationships between different variables.

Enjoy!
